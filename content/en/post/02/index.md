## ðŸ“Œ Week of July 2 â€“ July 8

The exam session is behind me, and now I can finally take a breath. The first days of vacation are all about well-deserved rest.  

Most of the week I spent at home â€” catching up on sleep and enjoying the freedom of having no strict schedule. At last, I had time to read books outside the academic program and spend quality moments with friends.  

The vacation has just begun, and there are plenty of plans ahead: trips, new hobbies, and self-development.
