## ðŸ“Œ Week of July 9 â€“ July 15

This week the vacation became more active. I met with classmates, we walked around Moscow together and discussed our plans for the upcoming academic year.  

I also visited a digital technology exhibition â€” it was fascinating to see real examples of how artificial intelligence and automation are applied in practice.  

In addition, I started exploring new hobbies: digital drawing and listening to English podcasts. The vacation is becoming not only a time for rest, but also an opportunity to grow in areas that truly inspire me.
