## ðŸ“Œ Week of June 25 â€“ July 1

This week marked the most intense part of the academic year â€” the exam session.  
The exams turned out to be a serious challenge: preparing for economics and programming was especially demanding.  

Despite the stress, it was rewarding to realize that the knowledge is gradually forming into a coherent system. A lot of time was spent in the library, consulting with professors, and solving problems together with classmates.  

The most important thing is that I managed to cope and gained valuable experience that will be useful in my further studies.
