## ðŸ“Œ Week of July 23 â€“ July 29

The vacation is gradually reaching its midpoint, and thoughts are beginning to return to studies.  

This week was dedicated to planning: I made a list of goals for the upcoming semester, highlighting courses and topics I want to explore further. I plan to focus especially on databases and the English language.  

I also tried keeping a study journal to structure tasks and track progress. Vacation provides time to reflect, which means it also helps prepare for new achievements.
