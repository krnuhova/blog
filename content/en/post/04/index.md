## ðŸ“Œ Week of July 16 â€“ July 22

This week was spent outdoors â€” together with friends we went out of town. It felt great to change the environment after the stressful exams and the hustle of city life.  

A campfire, forest walks, and late-night conversations helped me reset. I even managed to solve a couple of programming problems on my laptop â€” the brain keeps seeking activity anyway.  

Such a balance â€” rest combined with a bit of study â€” turned out to be very beneficial.
