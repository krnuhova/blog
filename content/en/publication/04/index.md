## 🔬 What is scientific programming?  

**Scientific programming** is the use of programming languages and tools to solve research-related problems:  
process modeling, data analysis, numerical computation, and visualization of results.  

Unlike applied programming, scientific programming emphasizes:  
- precision and reliability of algorithms,  
- working with large datasets,  
- support for numerical methods and mathematical libraries,  
- integration with visualization systems.

## 🧩 Key requirements for languages  

Scientific programming languages should provide:  
- **High performance** — for complex calculations and simulations.  
- **Mathematical expressiveness** — convenient notation for formulas and algorithms.  
- **Rich ecosystem of libraries** — for linear algebra, statistics, modeling.  
- **Portability** — ability to run code on clusters, supercomputers, and local machines.  
- **Integration** with visualization and analysis tools.
